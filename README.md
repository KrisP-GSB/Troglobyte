`Troglobyte` (TGB) is software written for the NiphNet sensors, which is the latest generation of the Niphargus sensors. These environmental sensors are developed by the Geological Survey of Belgium (Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences) to operate in harsh conditions. The name Niphargus (a shrimp-like cave dwelling animal) still refers to their original test ground. 

NiphNet is the new generation of sensors that will operate wireless using the LoRa network. Following a shift in hardware design, the new code will be developed in Arduino (C++). 

Code development will be documented on GitHub and made open source.
